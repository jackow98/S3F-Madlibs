# Mr Walker's feedback
# Great program, well done on your use of concatenation

# It is good to name variables with underscores or capitals for every new word
# nameofadrink would be nameOfADrink or name_of_a_drink
# Also could to put a colon at the end of your input to make it clear user needs to input
nameOfADrink = input('A name of a drink: ')
placeName = input('Name of a place: ')
name = input('Name of someones name: ')
nameOfFood = input('Name a food: ')

print('Hey, hey, hey, oh!')
print('Stop')
print('Wait a minute')
# You don't need the str(variableName), this is only needed if the variable is another type such as int or float
print('Fill my cup, put some ' + str(nameOfADrink))
print('in it')
print('Take a sip, sign a check' + str(name))
print(', get the stretch ')
print('Ride to' + str(placeName))
print('If we show up, we gon show out ')
print('Smoother than a fresh jar of ' + str(nameOfFood))
