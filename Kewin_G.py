# Mr Walker's feedback
# Good start, I have fixed your code below and left some comments

# I would have all your variables in one place
# 1. You can't have spaces in your variable names
# 2. You can't have the same variable name twice otherwise it will overwrite the first one
# 3. Could to use a colon at the end of input to make it clear to user to input
