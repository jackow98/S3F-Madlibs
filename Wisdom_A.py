# Mr Walker's feedback
# Good start and good use of variable naming, would be nice to see some concatenation and more lines

print("Welcome to Wavin' Flag Libs - Answer the following questions to create your capaldi libs")

place = input("Enter a famous land mark")
verb = input("Enter a verb")
country = input("Enter a country")
family_member = input("Enter a family member")

# Try think about using variables that will fit in your mad libs such as:
adjective = input("Enter an adjective with er at the end (e.g. wiser): ")

# Then use this variable in your print with concatenation (Use +)
print("When I get older I will be " + adjective)
